# Hack Approaches

* Classic Pentesting Approach (SQL Injection, csrf, xss)
* Have I been Pwned Approach.
* Fake the hack, Buy similar domain. (Ayyıldız Team Approach)
* Vulnerability DB approach, Check if any of libraries used are Vulnerable
* Wi-fi Phishing, (redirect victim to your website(!) over DNS with some social engineering)
* Server Attack, (getting control of aws account)
* Network Attack
* Check Vulnerability in each layer, (Intel->Ubuntu->Nginx) ya da (openssh, Mysql, Redis)
